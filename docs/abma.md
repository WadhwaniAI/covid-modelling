We have also developed an approximate uncertainty estimation algorithm which works on top of a set of Bayesian Optimisation trials. We call it Approximate Bayesian Model Averaging (ABMA)

Details of the algorithm can be found in our KDD Applied Data Science Track submission. Please contact @Sansiddh Jain to get access to that submission
